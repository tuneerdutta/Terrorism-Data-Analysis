# Terrorism-Data-Analysis

**----Introduction----**

In today's world, terrorism remains a significant threat to global peace and security. Understanding patterns, frequency, and characteristics of terrorist activities can help governments, researchers, and policy makers take informed action. This project analyzes terrorism-related data using modern data analytics tools to uncover meaningful insights about attack types, locations, targets, and trends over time.

**----Problem Statement----**

Terrorism data is vast, complex, and multidimensional, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights without proper analytics. Governments, security agencies, and researchers need accessible and actionable intelligence from raw data to understand where, how, and why attacks happen.

**----Objective----**

To analyze terrorism incidents globally and deliver meaningful visual insights that can help understand patterns in attack types, weapon use, targeted regions, and trends over time using Tableau Public.


**----Data Description----**

**----Future Scope----**


Based on the insights derived from the analysis of global terrorism data, several areas offer opportunities for future exploration and enhancement:

**1) Integration with Real-Time Data:**
Incorporating live or regularly updated data from international terrorism databases or news sources can help maintain a current understanding of trends and emerging threats.

**2) Predictive Analytics:**
Machine learning models could be developed to predict potential future attacks based on historical patterns, geographic hotspots, socio-political events, and seasonal trends.

**3) Deeper Regional Analysis:**
A more granular analysis at the state or city level could help local authorities better understand threats specific to their regions.

**4) Network Analysis of Terrorist Groups:**
Studying connections between different terrorist organizations, their geographical influence, and tactics could provide deeper strategic insights.

**5) Sentiment & News Analysis:**
Combining terrorism data with news and social media sentiment analysis could help understand public perception and detect early warning signals.

**6) Policy Impact Analysis:** 
Evaluating how different counter-terrorism policies affect the number and type of attacks could guide decision-making for governments and agencies.

**7) Interactive Web Application:**
Developing an interactive web-based platform could allow broader access to the data and visualizations for researchers, policy makers, and the general public.



**--Challenges Faced--**

**1) Data Quality and Cleaning:**
The dataset contained inconsistent naming, null values, and redundant columns which required meticulous cleaning using Excel Power Query.

**2) Complexity of Data Dimensions:**
With multiple dimensions such as attack type, weapon type, region, and year, filtering and structuring the visuals for clarity was challenging.

**3) Visualization Constraints:**
Creating an intuitive and performance-optimized dashboard on Tableau Public required balancing between detail and usability.

**4) Time Management:**
As a working professional, balancing the data exploration, cleaning, and visualization within limited time slots was a significant hurdle.
